    <h1>Basheer Tate Homepage</h1>
    <h3>Website Bio</h3>
    <p>
      This is a website made to show information about who Basheer is. Born in
      <span style="color: red">Detroit, MI</span> in December of 2005 he is 16
      years old and will be 18 years old in late 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was raised in many different areas around on Detroit's Westside.
      Growing up he was also part of the
      <a href="https://www.hiddengeniusproject.org"> Hidden Genius Project </a>
    </p>

    <h5>
      The hidden genius project trains and mentors black male youth in
      technology creation, entrepreneurship, and leadership skills to transform
      their lives and communities.
    </h5>

    <h5>
      Detroit is a city that at the time had been known for being one of the
      most dangerous cities in the United States. With 75% of Detroit Residents
      being African American, over 30% of the population living in poverty,
      along with a high unemployment rate of 5% compared to the average
      unemployment rate of 3.6% in the U. S.
    </h5>

    <h5>
      The hidden genius project started in California. In 2022 the hidden genius
      project added another location based in Detroit, MI. Which was a city with
      mostly African people and a city that was struggling to evolve. That's
      part of what made the hidden genius project expand to Detroit. To help
      teenagers to grow as a person, learn skills they need, and gain support to
      go in a better direction. The members of the Hidden Genius Project are
      also known for being well-rounded and educated people. This is why being a
      part of the program was a major part of learning and growing for Basheer
      at such a young age.
